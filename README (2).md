# SOC Automation Lab

## Objective
I built this SOC Automation Lab to develop and test automated security workflows that enhance threat detection, log analysis, and incident response. Using SIEM, SOAR, and custom scripts, I aim to reduce manual workload, improve response times, and minimize false positives. This project focuses on real-world SOC challenges, optimizing processes to strengthen security operations.

### Skills Learned
- SIEM Configuration & Tuning – Optimizing alerts, log ingestion, and correlation rules
- SOAR Automation – Implementing automated incident response playbooks
- Threat Intelligence Integration – Enriching alerts with external threat feeds
- Log Analysis & Correlation – Identifying patterns across multiple data sources
- Automated Alert Triage – Reducing false positives and prioritizing real threats
- Incident Response Automation – Enhancing remediation with scripted workflows
- Threat Hunting – Leveraging automation for anomaly detection and IOC analysis
- Scripting (Python, PowerShell, Bash) – Automating security tasks and log parsing
- API Integration – Connecting security tools for data exchange and workflow automation
- Reporting & Metrics – Automating SOC performance tracking and threat trends analysis

### Tools Used
- SIEM – Wazuh (log collection, analysis, and threat detection)
- SOAR & Case Management – TheHive (incident response and investigation workflows)
- Cloud Infrastructure – DigitalOcean (hosting and managing lab environments)
- Threat Intelligence – MISP (integrating threat feeds for enriched detection)
- Scripting & Automation – Python, Bash (automating security tasks and log parsing)
- Log Management – Wazuh (monitoring system logs and security events)
- API Integration – Connecting Wazuh, TheHive, and threat intelligence sources for automation
