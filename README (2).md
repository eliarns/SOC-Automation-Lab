# SOC Automation Lab

## Objective
I built this SOC Automation Lab to develop and test automated security workflows that enhance threat detection, log analysis, and incident response. Using SIEM, SOAR, and custom scripts, I aim to reduce manual workload, improve response times, and minimize false positives. This project focuses on real-world SOC challenges, optimizing processes to strengthen security operations.

### Skills Learned
- SIEM Configuration & Tuning – Optimizing alerts, log ingestion, and correlation rules
- SOAR Automation – Implementing automated incident response playbooks
- Threat Intelligence Integration – Enriching alerts with external threat feeds
- Log Analysis & Correlation – Identifying patterns across multiple data sources
- Automated Alert Triage – Reducing false positives and prioritizing real threats
- Incident Response Automation – Enhancing remediation with scripted workflows
- Threat Hunting – Leveraging automation for anomaly detection and IOC analysis
- Scripting (Python, PowerShell, Bash) – Automating security tasks and log parsing
- API Integration – Connecting security tools for data exchange and workflow automation
- Reporting & Metrics – Automating SOC performance tracking and threat trends analysis

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
